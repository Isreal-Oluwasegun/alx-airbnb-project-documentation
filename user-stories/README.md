# User Stories

This directory contains user stories derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone backend project.

User stories provide a human-centered way to describe how users interact with the system. They help translate system functionalities into clear, meaningful requirements from the userâ€™s point of view.

Each story follows the format:

> As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action], so that [I achieve a goal].

The full list of user stories can be found in the `user-stories.md` file in this directory.
